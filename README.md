DISCLAIMER: Despite this repository looking inactive, I have an internal build that's actively maintained. At the moment, I have the old code for this extension in a separate folder while I'm working on a redesigned version, featuring...
* a robust user system
* more verbose dive data tracking
* better organized data (i.e. less nesting of data, designed for searching content)
* a material design UI
* possible integration of cognitive services

With that being said, you can look to this README being updated, as I update the internal build with major changes, so stay tuned!

TODO:
- [ ] robust user authentication system (via firebase)
  * currently have user and password authentication
  * basic forms for signing in and registering and redirects to the other as when needed (i.e. trying to login but the user doesn't have an account or when the user already has an account)
- [ ] better highlighting (i.e. more consistent and doesn't destroy html structure 99.9% of the time)
  * currently implemented in old version of plugin, but can be moved to the new one
- [ ] add more stuff to the TODO list...
